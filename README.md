# Recipe Generator Chatbot üç≥ #
## ***Project Summary*** ##
The Recipe Finder Chatbot is an interactive AI-powered application that helps users explore and discover recipes based on their preferences. Built using Streamlit, the chatbot queries a FAISS vector database for relevant recipes and uses the Gemini API for AI-generated contextual responses. Users can ask queries like "low-calorie chicken recipe" or "quick pasta recipe," and the chatbot provides detailed information, including recipe descriptions, ingredients, steps, reviews, and ratings.This project leverages FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity searches and SentenceTransformers for embedding textual data. It integrates Streamlit to create a user-friendly conversational interface, making recipe discovery simple and fun.
